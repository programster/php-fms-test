* Decided to use a MongoDB GridFS based storage system because:
    * MySQL's largest column type only supports up to 4GiB whereas GridFS has no file size limit.
    * GridFS should (in theory) be easier to shard into a cluster, however the metadata can't, allowing for an extremely large storage pool.
    * Good opportunity to start using GridFS, a system I've never implemented before, but read about.
* Added docker support. 
    * build the container with bash build.sh
    * run the container with bash run-container.sh

----------------------
* Implemented the interfaces across classes that will utilise the MongoDB GridFS based storage system.
* I am confused some of the interface methods, for which I have put notes in the descriptions.
    * The folder and file classes have public setters I wouldn't expect.
    * Creation of the files/folders appear to be in the FileSystemInterface but take the file/folder as a parameter.
    * Appears to me that the File/Folder objects are just containers that may hold partial data and that the logic is supposed to all go in the FileSystemInterface?
